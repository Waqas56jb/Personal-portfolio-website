# Setup Instructions

## Install Missing Packages

The following packages need to be installed:

```bash
npm install react-icons react-toastify
```

Or simply run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies including:
- react-icons (for modern icons)
- react-toastify (for toast notifications)

## After Installation

Once packages are installed, run:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should compile without errors.

## Fixed Issues

✅ Removed unused imports (FaCogs, FaLaptop, FaChartLine)
✅ All 11 new projects are included
✅ No old projects remain in the list
✅ All components use React Icons
✅ Toast notifications configured
